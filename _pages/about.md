I am a researcher whose work lies at the intersection of social neuroscience, neuroeconomics, and behavioral science. I received a Ph.D. in Human Development Science from Mackenzie University in 2024.

I study social decision-making through experimental approaches grounded in Game Theory, investigating the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms that drive cooperative and prosocial behavior. To examine the neural basis of these processes, I use neuroimaging (fNIRS) and neuromodulation techniques (TMS, tDCS).
